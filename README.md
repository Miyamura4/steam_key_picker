At first you have to open "main.py" and pick number of keys. After will be created "keyss.txt" file.

Next make sure you have a full hd resolution. Open fullscreen steam window and open key activation window.IMPORTANT.Dont touch key activation window.

And finally, after generated steam keys open "new.py" and fast switch window to steam key activation.

It's my second job, be kind.

required libraries: sys, Thread, time, pynput, win32api, win32con, mouse, pyperclip, os, random, string
